# BiGRU Model - README

## Overview
This project implements a **BiGRU (Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit) model** using Python and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. BiGRU is an advanced type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that processes input sequences in both forward and backward directions, improving context learning in NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and machine translation.

## Features
- Implements a **Bidirectional GRU (BiGRU)** model.
- Processes sequential data with **both forward and backward dependencies**.
- Uses deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow/PyTorch) for implementation.
- Suitable for **Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications**.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas torch tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Files in the Repository
- **BIGRU (1).ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation and training of the BiGRU model.
- **README.md** - This documentation file.

## Usage
### Running the Notebook
1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Navigate to **BIGRU (1).ipynb** and run the cells sequentially.

### Model Training & Evaluation
- The notebook includes **data preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation**.
- Modify hyperparameters like **learning rate, number of layers, hidden units** inside the notebook.
- Supports **custom datasets**; update the data loading section accordingly.

## Model Architecture
The BiGRU model consists of:
- **Embedding Layer**: Converts words into vector representations.
- **Bidirectional GRU Layer**: Processes text in both forward and backward directions.
- **Fully Connected Layer**: Outputs predictions based on BiGRU outputs.

## Example Usage (PyTorch)
Below is a simple **BiGRU model implementation in PyTorch**:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class BiGRU(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size, num_layers=2):
        super(BiGRU, self).__init__()
        self.gru = nn.GRU(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, bidirectional=True, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size * 2, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        out, _ = self.gru(x)
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :])
        return out
```

## Performance & Improvements
- Tune **learning rate, batch size, and number of GRU layers** for better performance.
- Experiment with **dropout** and **regularization**.
- Use **pretrained embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT)** for better results.
